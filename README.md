# Artificial Emotional Intelligence

- a) We have observed and registered signals (Attention, Meditation, EEG and others) as reaction to stimuli, in this case reaction to video clip as stimuli. Signals recorded with Neurosky device. We have ten volunteers, ten signal datasets recorded using the same scenario and the same stimuli in real time. Video constructed using short video cuts, short clips – each clip has individual parameters and affect.
- b) Attention and meditation signals vary from 0% to 100%, 0% - means low affect or emotion and 100% maximum.
- c) Video stimulus constructed from parts, short clips – different clips and different stimuli. These stimuli annotated using Arousal and Valence metrics. There are given all necessarily data about short clips in table.

**General Task:** Perform analysis of signals and given dataset. Analysis combined from four practical tasks.

### Practical Task No. 1. Averages/means, max and standard deviations

- a) Calculate statistical measures (average/mean, max and standard deviation) for frequency, blink strength, EEG, Attention, Meditation signals for each volunteer. Final result should be in form of a table for each type of a signal. Also, prepare graphs and visualize stimuli signals (Arousal and Valence).

### Practical Task No. 2. Signal filtering

- a) Filter signals using Moving Average filter: for frequency, blink strength, EEG, Attention, Meditation signals and for each volunteer. Check and compare different moving average filtering parameters. Prepare graphs for each dataset, visualise filtered and not filtered signals on the same graph.
  Signal Frequency Domain characteristics – perform Fourier transformation for EEG and frequency signals. Visualize phase and amplitude characteristics for each dataset. Graph combined using two graphs: Top – Amplitude, Bottom Phase data for the same signal.

### Practical Task No. 3. Cross-Correlation and Pearson Correlation coefficients and functions

- a) Calculate cross-correlation between Frequency, Blink strength, EEG, Attention, Meditation signal for each pair of signals. Prepare table with maximums of Correlation coefficients. Visualize 2-3 correlation functions with the highest Correlation coefficients.
- b) Calculate Pearson Correlation between Frequency, Blink strength, EEG, Attention, Meditation signal for each pair of signals. Prepare table with maximums of Correlation coefficients. Visualize 2-3 correlation functions with the highest Correlation coefficients.
